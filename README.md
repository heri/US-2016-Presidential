# 2016 US Presidential Elections Spending

This application vizualizes the overall contributions to each candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in the USA.

Data comes from the NYTimes API.

In 2009, Barack Obama was the most funded candidate, by far and won the elections. In the 2009 version of this app, it was interesting to see the biggest corporate and individual contributors to his campaign. It was also possible to correlate success in fundraising with success in election day. Funding is not the only criteria but obviously gives the candidates the means for their ambition.

So far, only two condidates have reported contributions but data from Hillary Clinton or others should come soon.

## Todo

* Add list of biggest contributors, with possible links to wikipedia
* timeline graphs (sparkline?)
